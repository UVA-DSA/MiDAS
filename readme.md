> **EgoEMS** is the first end-to-end, high-fidelity multimodal multiperson dataset capturing egocentric video, audio, IMU data of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) procedures. Developed in collaboration with EMS professionals, it supports research in activity recognition, multimodal fusion, and cognitive assistance for real-time decision support.

## 📦 Overview

![Overall Structure](./Assets/EgoExoEMS-NEW_AAAI_Main_Figure.jpg)

EgoEMS provides >20 hours of synchronized multimodal data across 233 emergency scenarios, performed by over 45 trained EMS professionals and medical students. Each trial is annotated with keysteps, timestamped transcripts, and CPR metrics.

## 🎯 [Benchmarks](Benchmarks/README.md)

![Benchmarks](./Assets/EgoExoEMS-Benchmark.png)

We provide three primary benchmarks (with code and instructions in their respective folders):

1. [**Keystep Classification**](Benchmarks/ActionRecognition/README.md)

   → Classify procedural steps from multimodal input sequences.

2. [**Keystep Segmentation**](Benchmarks/ActionRecognition/README.md)   

   → Detect transitions between procedural keysteps over time.

3. [**CPR Quality Estimation**](Benchmarks/CPR_quality//README.md)   

   → Estimate compression rate and depth using smartwatch IMU and egocentric video.

Please visit each subfolder for detailed instructions, annotations, and code for each benchmark.
